# Restaurant page - Resto
This project is not mobile friendly. RWD - work in progress. <br> 

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run build` <br><br>
Builds the app for production to the dist folder.

`npm run start` <br><br>
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
If you want to use it you need to do `npm run build` first.

The page will reload if you make edits.

!Important </br>
You need to change path of css to dist in the main html. 

Example:

From css/main.css to dist/css/main.css

`npm run dev` <br><br>
It's runs `npm run start` and `npm run dev` at the same time. <br>
I recommend using this.
